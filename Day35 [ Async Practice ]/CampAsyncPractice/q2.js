// Write a function ‘delayedAddition’ that takes in two numbers and consoles their sum after a delay of 4 seconds using setTimeout. You can practice this question in any JS editor or your browser console.

// Your code here
const delayedAddition = (a, b) => {
    return setTimeout(() => console.log(a + b), 4000);
} 


delayedAddition(2, 3); 
// 5
